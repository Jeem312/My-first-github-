    Pasta salads are the ultimate summer picnic food and a great party dish at any time of year. You can make them ahead, and they can double as a side dish for some and a main dish for others. Plus, like all salad recipes, they’re a fantastic showcase for the season’s best produce.  </p>
    <p class="box"><span class="re">Crowd-Pleasing Slaws</span>
        Slaws are typically made with hardy veggies like cabbage, broccoli, or kale, so they hold up well if you dress them in advance. Because of this, they’re some of the best salad recipes to make ahead. Often, their flavor and texture even improve after an hour or two in the fridge</p>
